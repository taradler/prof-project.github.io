        About Me
    </h2>
    <p class="me1">My name is Tara and I'm 20 years old, I was borned and raised in Erbil.
        <br> I study in TISHK International university, IT Department, second grader.
        <br><br> About my interests, I'm interested in watching movies, learning languages
        <br> reading books, and sometimes cooking especially with music, belive me it's 
        <br> so good, you should give it a try!  :) .
        <br><br> Now my Buried Dream, When I was  in sixth grade at school, my dream was to be a pilot, I was young
        and never knew about obstacles, I thought whatever I choose
        I can be it, then when I grew older, pilot dream went  through my veins
        didn't let me to sleep at nights, always thinking about how things would be up high in the sky
    . I was going to lead hundreds of people in a plane, and the responsibilty,
    I was young and active full of energy, never knew about the borders.
     Growth changed so much in my life. When I grew older, before going to college
     there came lots of chances for me to study abroad as long as there wasn't any
     institute nor college for studying pilot here in Kurdistan, but as a girl I wasn't 
     capable of living alone abroad, then I knew how hard it is to be a girl, in this 
     closed-minded community. When I finished high-school I tried again, but again 
     I came back to the same point. When I was accepted in IT, I gave up. I gave up
     on my childhood dream, I buried all the thoughts that didn't let me sleep .....
     <br>  <br>
     Now my Biggest failure, when I was at school, so young still didn't memorize the colors
     of the rainbow, I was sent back home in a school day, for being lazy, and not  
     doing my studies well. I was called by stupid hundred times, bullied and made fun of,
     but never told my parents nor my siblings, because I thought this was a game.
     I had to leave my school for how lazy I was, I'm not going to accuse my parents for that
     because that time it was only my mother and she didn't know English, and my curriculum was in English,
     my father knew English but he was a soldier and was never at home.
     <br> I left the school, started making new friends and started to study on my own
     and grow up.
     <br><br> If you are interested in knowing what happened to Tara and how she is now,
