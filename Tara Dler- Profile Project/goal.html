        Main Goal
    </h2>
    <p class="me1"> My main goal in the catagories is, I want to motivate every young girls and boys out who are suffering 
        or suffered what I talked about in the <a href="aboutme.html"> About Me Article</a>  because those kinda problem we all faced or will face in our life,
        but the winner goes to the one that stands up and doesn't let them down.
        Girls out there are all strong enough to conquer the world, to heal the wold, and ofcourse
        I won't forget the strong boys out there, you are the greatest whose strength carries up the most hearts by the attraction of his own.
         <br><br> Life is filled with highs and lows which will test your resilience.
         Be sure to overcome all the challenges and bring out your inner strength. Push yourself to be a better and stronger version of yourself tomorrow. 
         I'll help you remember that The strongest people are people who faced the toughest situations in life. People who are defeated by the toughest battles
          are stronger than those who have won by using the escape route! Being a strong person does not only mean being strong physically or emotionally but preparing
           yourself to be able to overcome all the tests of life. When nothing seems to be going right, and you feel helpless that makes you weak and hopeless, thereâ€™s
            no reason to stay down, get up and come out of it stronger.
            <br><br>
            In the end, e always have something to lose, something we regret. That;s life we nticipate so much some that happen
            and some that never reach the shore, never reach us when we need them most. And for what? To live for a moment? To believe in something
            or have something, to keep you going, it's all for a reason, all for hope. I've learned in all my years, that in the end , that is what we live for. The little
            moments, the little victories ! Whether we keep them or not. 
            <br><br>
            The best lesson I can ever give it to someone is the realization of self-love and that alone is the most valuable lesson in the world.
            <br><br>
