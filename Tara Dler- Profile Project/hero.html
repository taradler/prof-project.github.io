        It's time to be a Hero
    </h2>
    <p class="me1"> The story of me didn't end like this, I didn't wait for the destiny to take me somewhere,
        I created my own destiny, I started building me. First of all, I started reading books and going to libraries
        started knowing people that I can learn stuff from them. I started writing my own book, and now it's been studied by
        students from my previous school, This is what we call standing up.  I started being a motivational speaker in schools
        and other girls trusted me so they shared there stories with me to find them a solution and so that 
        I can help them in what situation they are in .
        <br><br> Strong women have to know there place and there worth. Okay you have been bullied, abused, or made fun of
        maybe they saw you as a clown and you were always the funny dwarf,  but we step into blazing fire and come forward as a
        gold. Girls have to know what they feel and have to be confident in her thoughts. Her voice must be a dagger and her heart is the fire that casts 
        it. 
        <br><br>
        This page almost looks like  as a motivational page. 
        <br><br>To grow and find your own path we should stop playing the
         waiting game these days, that "Later" should turn into "Too late" . When you created your path then this means
        you are smart for taking your time deciding how you want your life to be and not settling for just one problem that you face . 
        <br><br>
        What you face today, creates you and you future .
